Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

OOP Semester project

The Face Recognition Attendance System is an application designed to automate the process of marking attendance for students and teachers using facial recognition technology. The system captures a photo of the individual, detects their face, and logs the attendance details along with the photo. The attendance records can be viewed for both students and teachers.

Features
Student Attendance: Mark attendance for students by capturing their face and logging their details.
Teacher Attendance: Mark attendance for teachers by capturing their face and logging their details, including their shift.
View Attendance Logs: Display attendance logs for both students and teachers.
Face Detection: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time.

Dependencies
C++ Standard Library
OpenCV (Version 4.0 or higher)
A webcam or camera for capturing photos
